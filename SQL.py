# SELECT
SELECT column_name,column_name FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM table_name;                                  # Selects all the columns from the "Customers" table
SELECT DISTINCT column_names FROM table_name;              # The DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values


# WHERE
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE Country='Mexico';           # The WHERE clause is used to filter records
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE CustomerID=1;

# WHERE, MATCH, AGAINST
SELECT ... WHERE MATCH(tablename, headline) AGAINST (+Django -jazz Python IN BOOLEAN MODE);

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;  # display the products outside the range between 10 to 20
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE (Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20) AND NOT CategoryID IN (1,2,3); 
# selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20, but products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3 should not be displayed

# LIKE and Wildcard
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE City LIKE 's%';             # selects all customers with a City starting with the letter "s"

SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;   # sort the result-set.  +DESC sorted DESCENDING

INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);

# UPDATE
UPDATE table_name SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Hamburg' WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste'   # remember about the WHERE statme

# SELECT TOP/LIMIT
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name FROM table_name;     # SQL Server / MS Access Syntax
SELECT column_name FROM table_name LIMIT number;           # MySQL, PostgreSQL
SELECT * FROM COMPANY LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;					   # with offset - select id 3, 4, 5
