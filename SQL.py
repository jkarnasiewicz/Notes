SQL stands for Structured Query Language


# SELECT
SELECT column_name, column_name FROM table_name;

# WHERE
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE Country='Mexico';           # The WHERE clause is used to filter records

# WHERE, MATCH, AGAINST
SELECT ... WHERE MATCH(tablename, headline) AGAINST (+Django -jazz Python IN BOOLEAN MODE);


# BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';		# selects all fields where country is NOT "Germany" and NOT "USA"

# % - percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
# _ - underscore represents a single character

# ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;   # sort the result-set.  +DESC sorted DESCENDING

# GROUP BY
# GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns

# HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions

# NULL Value

# JOIN
# JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them

# (INNER) JOIN 				returns records that have matching values in both tables

# UNION
# UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements

# INSERT INTO
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);

# UPDATE

# FUNCTIONS

# MIN, MAX
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice FROM Products;

# COUNT function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
