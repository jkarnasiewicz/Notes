# namedtuple
# namedtuple can be used to build classes of objects that are just bundles of attributes with no custom methods, like a databaserecord
# The collections.namedtuple function is a factory that produces subclasses of tuple enhanced with field names and a class name â€” which helps debugging
# You can access the fields by name or position

# from collections import namedtuple
# City = namedtuple('City', 'name country population coordinates')
# tokyo = City('Tokyo', 'JP', 36.933, (35.689722, 139.691667))



# special methods - the Python interpreter is the only frequent caller of most special methods


# __repr__() - The string returned by __repr__ should be unambiguous and, if possible, match the source code necessary to recreate the object being represented
# representation should looks like calling the constructor of the class

# __str__- which is called by the str() constructor and implicitly used by the print function. __str__ should return a string suitable for display to end-users

# If you only implement one of these special methods, choose __repr__



# Container sequences
# list, tuple and collections.deque can hold items of different types.
# Flat sequences
# str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview and array.array hold items of one type.
# Container sequences hold references to the objects they contain, which may be of any
# type, while flat sequences physically store the value of each item within its own memory
# space, and not as distinct objects. Thus, flat sequences are more compact, but they are
# limited to holding primitive values like characters, bytes and numbers



# __next__ example
# class Sensor:

#     def __init__(self):
#         self._list = [1, 3, 5]
#         self.index = -1

#     def __iter__(self):
#         return self

#     def __next__(self):
#         try:
#             result = self._list[self.index]
#             self.index -= 1
#         except IndexError:
#             self.index = -1
#             raise StopIteration
#         return result

#     def __next__(self):
#         'Returns the next value till current is lower than high'
#         if self.current > self.high:
#             raise StopIteration
#         else:
#             self.current += 1
#             return self.current - 1
