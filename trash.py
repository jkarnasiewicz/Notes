# .					matches any character except a newline
# *                 match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE
# +                 match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE
# ?					match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE

# greedy - they match as much text as possible
# <.*> is matched against '<a> b <c>', it will match the entire string, and not just <a>

# non-greedy or minimal fashion - they match as few characters as possible
# <.*?> is matched against '<a> b <c>', will match only <a>



# ^					matches the start of a string
# $					matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string

# {m}				specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched
# {m, n}			(greedy)causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible
# {m, n}?			(non-greedy)causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as few repetitions as possible

# [] 				indicate a set of characters, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k', special characters lose their special meaning inside sets e.g. [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'
# [^/]+             which will match everything up to the first /

# (...)             matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, and indicates the start and end of a group
# (A|B|C)           match exactly one of A, B, or C
# (?P<name>...)     similar to regular parentheses, but the substring matched by the group is accessible via the symbolic group name name

# \d                digit (0â€“9)
# \D                non digits

# \b                empty string boundary
# \B 				empty string non boundary

# \w 				alphanumeric
# \W 				non-alphanumeric

# \s 				whitespace
# \S 				non whitespace

# \A 				start of the string
# \Z 				end of the string
